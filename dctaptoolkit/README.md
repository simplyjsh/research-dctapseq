## Sceptre

Work-in-progress.

### Overview {#sceptre-overview}

Work-in-progress.

### Purpose {#sceptre-purpose}

Work-in-progress.

### Available Tools {#sceptre-availabletools}

- [sceptre-formattertools-cli](./sceptre/sceptre-formattertools-cli/):
  Work-in-progress.
- [sceptre-input-datacleaning-oneoff](./sceptre/sceptre-input-datacleaning-oneoff/):
  DEPRECATED: This sub-module is not a tool and will soon be archived.
  ~~Preliminary one-off task to format guide-target design library to
  be usable as sceptre input for DC-TAP-seq Analysis Workflow.~~

## qPCR

Work-in-progress.

### Overview {#qpcr-overview}

Work-in-progress.

### Purpose {#qpcr-purpose}

Work-in-progress.

### Available Tools {#qpcr-availabletools}

- [qpcr-analysis-tool-v001](./qpcr/qpcr-analysis-tool-v001/):
  SOON TO BE DEPRECATED: Initial implementation of helper scripts to analyze  
  qPCR data to orthogonally validate DC-TAP-seq dataset effect sizes. The
  script adapted to the standardized qPCR experimental design optimized
  by the folks at the Lander Lab and the Broad. In addition, generic
  helper methods were added to format the unique biological conditions
  of hiPSC differentiated samples.
